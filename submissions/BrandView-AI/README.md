# Project Title
**BrandView AI â€“ YouTube Influencer Intelligence Agent**

## Overview of the Idea
BrandView AI is a smart agent built with **Agno** that helps brands evaluate YouTube creators for influencer marketing. It analyzes channels and videos to help marketers find safe, high-performing influencers, faster and more accurately than doing manual research.

## Project Goal
To build an intelligent agent that allows brands to instantly:
1. Understand a creator's audience and past performance  
2. Assess risk and sentiment around their content  
3. Analyze how they handle sponsorships  
4. Estimate ROI and CPM based on past metrics  
5. Discover and evaluate new talent by crawling talent agency websites  

## How It Works
Marketers interact with BrandView AI using simple chat prompts. Behind the scenes, the system (a coordinated team of specialized sub-agents) fetches YouTube data, processes it using Python-based tools, and delivers clear, actionable results. For complex calculations, a dedicated Python coder agent writes and executes code on the fly.

Each request can trigger a workflow involving:
- Resolving channel identifiers  
- Collecting channel and video data  
- Transcribing video audio to text  
- Analyzing video content for sponsor segments  
- Conducting risk and sentiment analysis  
- Running Python scripts for metric calculations  
- Crawling influencer talent agency websites to discover new collaborators  

All of this happens transparently within a single conversational interface.

### Example User Journeys:

ðŸ§  User: "Find the top 5 German influencers that are managed by the agency co-mng.de. Make sure they have a YouTube channel."  
ðŸ’¬ Agent:  
- Uses the Talent Specialist agent to crawl co-mng.de website and extract talent information
- Filters for German influencers with YouTube channels
- Ranks them based on their YouTube metrics using the Channel Data Collector
- Response: "_Found 5 German influencers managed by co-mng.de. Here are their channels ranked by subscriber count and engagement metrics..._"

ðŸ§  User: "What would be the price that I should pay CashJordan to keep the CPM under 35â‚¬? Fetch the views for the last 20 videos and use the median for the estimation."  
ðŸ’¬ Agent:  
- Channel ID Resolver finds CashJordan's official channel ID
- Video Statistics Specialist fetches the last 20 videos' statistics
- Python Script Executor calculates the median views
- Metrics Calculator determines the maximum price to maintain CPM under 35â‚¬
- Response: "_Based on the median views of 450K from the last 20 videos, you should pay no more than â‚¬15,750 to maintain a CPM under 35â‚¬._"

ðŸ§  User: "Find 3 biggest YouTube influencers in India focused on tech content. Present the channels in the table with columns: Channel name and URL, Followers, Average Views, Average Likes, Average comments. Leave a link to the report document."  
ðŸ’¬ Agent:  
- Channel Search Specialist searches for Indian tech YouTube channels
- Channel Data Collector gathers detailed metrics for each channel
- Python Script Executor calculates averages for views, likes, and comments
- Document Generator creates a formatted report with the table
- Response: "_Here are the top 3 Indian tech influencers with their metrics. View the detailed report here: [Report Link]_"

## How It All Happens Behind the Scenes

- Individual specialized sub-agents (e.g., Channel ID Resolver, Channel Data Collector, Video Analysis Specialist, Risk & Sentiment Analyzer, Document Generator, Python Script Executor, Metrics Calculator, Video Statistics Specialist, Talent Specialist) coordinate under a central team orchestration to handle each task in parallel when needed.
- The Python coder agent (Python Script Executor) writes and runs code for any metric calculations or report generation.
- Firecrawl is used strictly to crawl influencer management agency websites for talent discoveryâ€”not for scraping scandal or controversy content.
- Video audio is transcribed on demand (audioâ†’text) for deeper analysis of transcripts.
- Video content analysis (scene parsing and sponsor detection) is performed via the `analyze_video_content` tool.
- Risk and sentiment insights are drawn from comments and online searches using the `sentiment_score` tool and web search tools.
